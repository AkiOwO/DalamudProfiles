# DalamudProfiles

With DalamudProfiles you can create custom plugin presets. This is usefull if you have plugins that you only need while raiding so you don't have to disable them everytime. Just select your profile and start XIVLauncher through the program.

For now this is super Alpha, basically coded this in one evening.
Still has a messy GUI for now.

# What it does

DalamudProfiles creates a new folder called "uninstalledPlugins" in the XIVLauncher directory. All unloaded plugins are moved to this folder. To enable the Plugins again, DalamudProfiles moves the unloaded Plugins back into the "installedPlugins" folder.

# TODO

- Clean up GUI
- ~~Remove hardcoded stuff and add a settings window~~
- Clean up code
- Make code failproof
