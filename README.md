# DalamudProfiles

With DalamudProfiles you can create custom plugin presets. This is usefull if you have plugins that you only need while raiding so you don't have to disable them everytime. Just select your profile and start XIVLauncher through the program.

For now this is super Alpha, basically coded this in one evening.
Still has a messy GUI and hardcoded filepaths for now.
